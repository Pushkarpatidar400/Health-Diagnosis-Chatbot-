# Health Diagnosis using AI Chatbot

## Overview
This project implements a Health Diagnosis system using an AI chatbot. The chatbot assists users in determining potential health issues based on symptoms provided by the user. The system utilizes a Decision Tree classifier for prognosis prediction, and it provides information about the predicted condition, severity, precautions, and suggests consulting a doctor.

## Files and Directories

- **app.py**: Flask web application that integrates the chatbot functionality into a web interface.
- **index.html**: HTML file containing the user interface for the chatbot.
- **MasterData/**: Directory containing master data files for symptom descriptions, severity, and precautions.
- **Data/**: Directory containing training and testing datasets.
- **healthcare-chatbot/Data/Training.csv**: CSV file containing training data for the machine learning model.
- **healthcare-chatbot/Data/Testing.csv**: CSV file containing testing data for the machine learning model.
- **healthcare-chatbot/Data/doctors_dataset.csv**: CSV file containing information about doctors associated with specific diseases.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pyttsx3

Install the required packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install flask pandas scikit-learn numpy pyttsx3
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
3. Run the Flask application by executing the following command:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the chatbot interface.

## Usage
- Enter your name when prompted to start the chat.
- Type the symptoms you are experiencing when prompted.
- Follow the chatbot's questions and provide relevant information.
- The chatbot will predict potential health issues, provide descriptions, precautions, and suggest consulting a doctor.
- The system also suggests respected doctors based on the predicted condition.

## Project Structure
- **Chatbot Integration**: The Python code integrates the AI chatbot into a web interface using Flask and HTML.
- **Machine Learning Model**: The project utilizes a Decision Tree classifier for health prognosis prediction.
- **Master Data**: Descriptions, severity, and precaution data are stored in CSV files within the MasterData directory.
- **Doctor Information**: Information about doctors associated with specific diseases is stored in the doctors_dataset.csv file.

## Additional Notes
- The project uses pyttsx3 for text-to-speech functionality.
- The Decision Tree model is trained on a provided dataset (Training.csv) for health prognosis.
- Master data files (symptom_Description.csv, Symptom_severity.csv, symptom_precaution.csv) provide additional information for the chatbot.

Feel free to explore the code and customize it according to your requirements.
